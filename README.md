# Javascript Password Generator

## Description

The foundation for this project was provided by an online bootcamp for [Full-Stack Development](https://bootcamps.vanderbilt.edu/coding/online/landing/). 

You can view the live project [here](https://joelkovalcson.github.io/Javascript-Quiz/).

This project's purpose was to create a quiz about JavaScript. The entire website was created from scratch.

The quiz had to follow the following guidelines for the assignment:
* Timer counting down when the quiz starts
  - When an incorrect answer is given, subtract from timer
* When a question is answered, move on to the next question.
* After all questions are answered or the timer runs out, let user submit their score.
* Have a high score page that uses `localStorage` to save user data

## What I Did

I began by creating an outline in HTML/CSS of the start page that gave information to the user about the quiz. After I finished styling and creating the framework for the quiz I moved on to setting up the JavaScript structure. During this planning I decided that I wanted to have a randomized and dynamic quiz structure with a sorted leaderboard, so I made plans accordingly in my design structure for that. Once I finished the quiz logic I did a few touch ups and added the questions in.

## Notes

If I were to come back to this, I would try and avoid as much hard-coded HTML inside of my JavaScript file(s).
